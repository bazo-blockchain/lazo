Lazo is a statically typed, imperative and non-turing complete programming language.
Please refer to [lazo-specification](https://github.com/bazo-blockchain/lazo-specification) for the complete language features.

## Background

The Bazo Blockchain is a research blockchain to test different mechanisms and algorithms. 
In the current version, there is a virtual machine available to interpret and execute IL codes on the Bazo Blockchain.

The goal of this bachelor thesis is to build a compiler, which compiles the smart contracts written in the Lazo language 
into the Bazo Byte Code for the [Bazo Virtual Machine](https://github.com/bazo-blockchain/bazo-vm).

## Usage

The Lazo tool works with the CLI commands.
Run `lazo` to see all the available commands and their usages.

    $ lazo
    Lazo is a tool for managing Lazo source code on the Bazo Blockchain
    
    Usage:
      lazo [flags]
      lazo [command]
    
    Available Commands:
      compile     Compile the Lazo source code
      help        Help about any command
      run         Compile and run the lazo source code on Bazo VM
      version     Print the version number of Lazo
    
    Flags:
      -h, --help   help for lazo
    
    Use "lazo [command] --help" for more information about a command.

Example:
* `lazo compile program.lazo`: Compile the source file *program.lazo* through all stages into Bazo byte code.
* `lazo compile program.lazo --stage=p`: Compile the source code only until the parser stage.
* `lazo run program.lazo`: Compile the source file and execute generated byte code on Bazo VM
                
## Development

Run `./scripts/set-hooks.sh` to setup git hooks.

###  Dependency Management

Packages are managed by [Go Modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules). 

Set the environment variable `GO111MODULE=on` and run `go mod vendor` 
to install all the dependencies into the local vendor directory.

### Run Compiler from Source

    go run main.go compile program.lazo

It will compile the given source code file "*program.lazo*".

### Run Unit Tests

    go test ./... 

It will run all tests in the current directory and all of its subdirectories.

To see the test coverage, run `./scripts/test.sh` and then open the **coverage.html** file.

### Run Lints

TODO

### Build Compiler

    go build 

It will create an executable for the current operating system (e.g. `lazo.exe` in Windows).

### Install Compiler

    go install
    
It will build an executable and place it in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.
Thus, `lazo` command will be available in the terminal from anywhere.
